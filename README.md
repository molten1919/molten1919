### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Alejandro, I am a physicist and data scientist, with experience in the investigation of inflationary cosmological models of the universe, using the FLRW metric combining the gravitational action of Einstein - Hilbert with modified theories of gravity. I also have experience as a Project Manager, leading a team for a data engineering and data analysis project, developing a recommendation migration system for an NGO, using Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit learn, MySql, AWS and GitHub.
